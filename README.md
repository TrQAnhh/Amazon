## 📖 Overview

### Backend (NestJS Microservices)

It handles authentication, profiles, product inventory, orders, and payments.

#### Core Services

    - JWT authentication with access/refresh tokens.
    - `Redis-based` token blacklisting for logout and session invalidation.
    - Passport strategies (JWT, extendable for OAuth).

    - CRUD operations for user profiles.
    - Avatar upload and management using Cloudinary.
    - Secure access integrated with the Identity Service.

- **🛍️ Product Service**
    - Full product CRUD operations.
    - Search and filter capabilities.
    - Inventory tracking and stock management.

- **💳 Order Service**
    - Order creation, update, and cancellation.
    - Payment integrations: `Stripe` and Cash on Delivery (COD).
    - Stripe webhook handling for real-time payment status updates.

#### Additional Backend Details
- **Database:** MySQL with TypeORM and migrations.
- **Architecture Patterns:** `CQRS` with `Mediator pattern` for clear separation of commands and queries.
- **Validation:** `class-validator` & `class-transformer`.
- **API Gateway:** `TCP-based` communication between services.
- **Documentation:** Swagger + Postman collections.
- **Development:** `Docker-based` containerization for local and production-ready deployments.
